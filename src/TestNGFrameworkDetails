TestNG-- Java unit testing framework
-Available as JAR file
-TDD--Test Driven Development
-Open source

Note : To run all the classes in the package we will create an xml(testng.xml) file in source folder and include all classes in that as a test suite.
Then run the xml file as testNG test suite to execute all the test cases.

Purpose:Design test cases in a systematic way
- html report
- Different Annotations
- Data provider
- Grouping of test cases - @Test(groups="")
- Priority/sequence of test cases @Test(priority=1)
- Dependency @Test(dependsOnMethods = "login") or @Test(dependsOnGroups = "title")
- supports Parameterization
- Supported by lot of tools and plugins
- Multithread support


Annotations available:
Note : Each Annotation should be associated with a method
--Pre-Condition annotations
-@BeforeSuite
-@BeforeTest
-@BeforeClass
-@BeforeMethod

--Test cases
-@Test

--Post-Condition annotations
-@AfterMethod
-@AfterClass
-@AfterTest
-@AfterSuite

For each @Test (test case) @BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod will be executed
Testcase1:
@BeforeMethod 
@Test
@AfterMethod

Testcase2:
@BeforeMethod 
@Test
@AfterMethod

Testcase3:
@BeforeMethod 
@Test
@AfterMethod

Features :
- Invocation count -- with this attribute or feature we can run a test multiple times(@Test(invocationCount = 3))
- timeout -- with this we can set timeout in milliseconds (@Test(timeout = 2))
- expectedExceptions -- with this we can handle exceptions (@Test(expectedExceptions = NumberFormatException.class))
